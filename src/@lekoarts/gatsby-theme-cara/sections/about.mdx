## About

I am a senior studying Computer Science and Physics in San Jose State University.
I have experience in JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, C, C++, R, SQL, HTML, CSS.
My curiosity leads me to learn new technologies and development techniques every day.
I chose that field of study because Iâ€™ve always been interested in math, physics, and logical thinking.
Most importantly, I want to utilize my technical skills to build a lot of amazing products that many people can benefit from.
I truly hope I am able to make this world better and better.
